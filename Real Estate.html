<p><strong>DHA Quetta will release a tender for the development of Signature Houses</strong>
    <br/>
    <br/>


    Quetta: The Defence Housing Authority (DHA) Quetta has chosen to hire contractors to build 'Signature Houses' as part of the residential programme. (Reported by news source)
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DHA Quetta has invited bids from contractors registered with the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and DHA Quetta (C-5 and above) for the construction of grey structures of Signature Houses of various sizes (1-kanal, 5- & 16-marla) in Sector A, Phase-I of the housing society.

    <br/>

    According to the latest media reports, these banks and some money exchange companies too added fuel to fire when the US dollar started flying out of Pakistan soon after a successful regime change operation in the country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This indicates that interested firms can acquire tender paperwork from the Director of Town Planning & Building Control, DHA Quetta, during office hours. The documents will be available from June 5th through June 15th. The tender documents can be accessed by submitting a written request on the firm's letterhead and making a non-refundable payment of PKR 5,000 per set as a pay order benefiting DHA Quetta.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Incomplete materials will be considered non-responsive and will be rejected. DHA Quetta maintains the right to reject any or all enterprises in accordance with the rules and regulations. To be considered, bid documents given by DHA Quetta must be hand-filled by the contractor.
