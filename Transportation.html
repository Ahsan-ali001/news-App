<p><strong>KARACHI:</strong><br/>
    The Sindh government on Thursday announced its decision to launch a Pink People's Bus service for women in Karachi.
    <br/>
    <br/>


    The decision was made in a meeting chaired by Provincial Minister for Transport Sharjeel Inam Memon. The minister stated that the Pink Peopleâ€™s Bus service would begin operations on February 1 and its first route would be from Model Colony, Shahrah-e-Faisal to Tower.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sharjeel said that a pink bus would run every 20 mins during morning and evening office commuting hours and once every hour during the day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    
    The meeting also reviewed the operations of the People's Bus Service in Sukkur, Larkana, and Hyderabad and the launch of Route 4, 5, 6 and 7 in Karachi. The provincial minister ordered the initiation of the People's Bus Service in Sukkur on January 29.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He also directed the managing director of the Sindh Mass Transit Authority to visit the remaining routes of the People's Bus Service in Karachi and assess the improvement of the roads.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Sharjeel said that buses should operate on routes 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Karachi as soon as possible so that more citizens have the facility of modern public transport.

    Secretary Transport Abdul Halim Sheikh, Managing Director Sindh Mass Transit Authority Zubair Chana, and Operations Manager National Radio and Telecommunications Abdul Shakur were present at the meeting.
<br/>
<br/>
    Earlier this month, Sharjeel announced the launch of Pakistan's first electric bus service in Karachi.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In a tweet, the minister said that the people of the metropolis will be able to avail of the bus service from today.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "This service will start from Tank Chowk Malir Cantt to Clock Tower Roundabout, Sea View Defence using Khayaban e Ittehad," he said, adding that airport passengers can also avail of this service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to the Sindh Mass Transit Authority, these electric buses are environmentally friendly as they are charged via solar energy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Additionally, the fares for these bases will be low while they offer a comfortable ride.
